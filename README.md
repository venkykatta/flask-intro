## Description:
 A simple flask application.

 ## Installation:
  1.Now, in this application we use the [pyhton3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) version.
  
  2.And also  setup the [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) in your local directory.

  3.And finally run the application with command as "python3 -m flask run"

  ## How to Run:
    1.Once a collaborator pulls down your project - they can then install a fresh python environment that is,

      "python3 -m venv local_python_environment"
    
    2.And then activate that environment and install from your requirements.txt which you have included in your version control:

       "source local_python_environment/bin/activate"

    3.Then after we install  the requirements.txt file in our local directory that is like:
    
         "(local_python_environment) $ pip install -r requirements.txt"
